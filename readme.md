# Data Structures and Algorithms Learning Repository

## Purpose

This repository is created to systematically learn and practice **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. It provides a structured way to explore different topics, solve problems, and improve problem-solving skills.

## Introduction

The repository follows a simple folder structure where each topic (e.g., **Array**, **Linked List**) has subdirectories representing specific problems or concepts. A **template folder** is used as a starting point, allowing quick setup for new learning exercises by simply copying and pasting it into the relevant topic folder.

## Folder Structure

```
- array
    - example-1
    - example-2
- linked-list
    - example-1
- template
    - index.html
    - script.js
```

### How to Use

1. Choose a data structure or algorithm to learn.
2. Copy the `template` folder and rename it accordingly.
3. Implement the solution in `script.js` and update `index.html` as needed.
4. Open the project in **VS Code** and use the **Live Server** extension to preview changes in real-time.
   - Run Live Server by right-clicking `index.html` and selecting **Open with Live Server**.
   - Or use the command: **Go Live** from the VS Code status bar.
5. Repeat the process for new topics or problems.

## Goals

- Build a strong foundation in **Data Structures and Algorithms**.
- Improve coding skills by implementing various problems.
- Maintain an organized and reusable learning environment.
- Track progress by keeping a record of completed exercises.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
