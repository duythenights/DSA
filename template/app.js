/*

I’m learning Data Structures and Algorithms. Answer the following question using this structured format:

1. Verify the constraints
2. Write out some test cases
3. Find out a solution without code (brute-force idea)
4. Write out the brute-force solution in JavaScript
5. Write out the optimized solution and explain the logic
6. Provide Big O analysis

Question: Given an array of integers, return the indices of the numbers that add up to a given number.

/*
KEYS for every questions:
Just trying to solve the question by using brute-force answers.
Then you think: Is there any way to optimized the complexity algorithm by using:
- Another Datascture
    + Hash map instead of Array (finding items)
    + Set instead of Array (checking duplicate items) 
    + ...
- Another Algorithm:
    + Binary search instead of Linear search
    + Recursive instead of For Loop
    + ...

- Changing data structure:
    + 🧠 Usually a Time ↔ Space Trade-off

- Changing the algorithm:
    + 🧠 Can Be a Trade-off, But Not Always
